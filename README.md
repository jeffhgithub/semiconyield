# Semiconductor Yield Analysis 
This document describes a custom Application built around semiconductor yield analyst workflows.  The tool was quite popular and evolved to service many additional user personas, both technical and non-technical... daily users included the production workers all the way up to the General Manager.  

This custom application took advantage of an existing data pipeline that was created for other use case specific, expert user software platforms. The pipeline was enriched and API's were implemented that leveraged the embedded capabilities of these expert systems to implement machine learning results wrapped in a context that fit the natural workflows of users. This proved to be immensely popular as users no longer needed to learn very complicated expert systems to perform analyses. 

My role in this application's existance:
- Started as the Analyst who drove the requirements and use cases; I defined what data was needed, the transformations required and the analysis/visualizations that were required as well as heavy input on the UX.
- I was the first user, the evangalist, I became a partner in funding resources and eventually became the Director over the develpment and data analyst teams who created and used the tools on a daily basis. 

The capabilities of this tool have been disclosed in more than one publication with the approval of LSI Logic. There is no addtional information contained here that has not already been disclosed in the public domain.
